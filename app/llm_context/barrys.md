# Barry's Bootcamp

## What Barry's Is
Barry's (originally Barry's Bootcamp) is a 50–60 minute high-intensity group fitness class split into two alternating components: treadmill running intervals and floor-based dumbbell strength work. Half the class is on treadmills, the other half on the floor at the same time, then they switch. Classes are held in dark, red-lit studios ("The Red Room") with loud, high-energy music. Each day has a body-part focus. It is one of the most imitated boutique fitness formats in the world.

## Session Structure — THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
The defining feature of Barry's is the alternating treadmill/floor split. Every session must have both. A 50-minute session has two alternating blocks:

1. Treadmill Block 1 — ~12 min
2. Floor Block 1 — ~12 min
3. Treadmill Block 2 — ~12 min
4. Floor Block 2 — ~12 min
5. Cool-down — 3–5 min

A 45-minute session has one treadmill block and one floor block (~18 min each). A 60-minute session may have three alternating blocks.

## Class Days / Body-Part Focus
- Monday: Full Body
- Tuesday: Chest, Back & Abs
- Wednesday: Butt & Legs
- Thursday: Arms & Abs
- Friday: Full Body
- Saturday: Full Body
- Sunday: Legs & Butt

Generate the floor work based on today's focus day, or pick a focus if not specified.

## Treadmill Block Protocol
Barry's uses three named pace bands called out by the instructor:
- **Base Pace** — comfortable, conversational jog. Recovery and default speed between efforts.
- **Push Pace** — moderately hard. Uncomfortable but holdable for 1–2 min. Typically 1–2 notches above base on the treadmill.
- **All Out / Red Line** — maximum sprint. 30–60 seconds only. Everything you have.

Typical treadmill block structure (~12 min):
- 2 min base pace
- 1 min push pace → 30s base × 3 sets
- 45s all-out → 1 min base × 2 sets
- 1 min push pace at incline (8–12%)
- 30s all-out sprint to finish

Use `for_time` or `rounds` format for treadmill blocks. Specify distances or durations. Use incline frequently.

**If no treadmill:** substitute rower (500m intervals), SkiErg, or assault bike using the same three-pace structure (easy / moderate / all-out).

## Floor Block Protocol
Dumbbell-focused. 3–4 exercises per block, 3–4 sets each, moderate to heavy dumbbells. Short rest (15–30s between sets). Always specify dumbbell weight. Abs are included in most floor blocks regardless of the day's focus.

Use `rounds` or `straight` format for floor blocks.

**Weight guidance:** Use effort-based cues rather than absolute numbers. For isolation and higher-rep exercises: "light — you should be able to complete all reps with control." For compound movements: "moderate-to-heavy — the last 2–3 reps should feel challenging." If the athlete has known working weights (see Athlete Context), use those as a starting point.

## Exercise Bank by Focus Day

**Abs (always mix in):**
Weighted Sit-up, Russian Twist, Bicycle Crunch, Leg Raise, Dead Bug, Plank Hold, Flutter Kicks, V-up

## Coaching Style
- Instructor-led, very high energy with short rest and constant motivation
- Weights use effort cues so athletes self-select appropriate load
- Rest between floor sets is short (15–30s), just time to reset
- Modifications offered but the default is high intensity
- "Give me everything you've got" for the all-out treadmill sprints

## Key Characteristics
- Alternating treadmill + floor blocks — this is what makes it Barry's
- Floor work is always dumbbell-based, never barbell
- Body-part focus changes by day
- Abs appear in almost every session
- Sessions feel relentless — very little standing around
- The treadmill pace structure (base / push / all-out) must be reflected in the treadmill sections
