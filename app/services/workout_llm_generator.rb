      guidance: <<~TREAD_SHRED.strip
        Tread & Shred sessions have a strict structure — follow this exactly:

        WARM-UP: Section name: "Warm-up Jog". format: straight, duration_mins: 5. One exercise only: "Light Jog" with duration_s: 300. No rounds, no stretching, no activation, no other exercises.

        MAIN SET STRUCTURE: For every 30 minutes of main set time, generate exactly 1 treadmill block and 1 floor block, strictly alternating (tread → floor → tread → floor). Each block is 10-14 minutes.
        - 30-min session: warm-up → 1 tread → 1 floor → cool-down
        - 45-min session: warm-up → 1 tread → 1 floor → 1 tread → cool-down (or add a short floor finisher)
        - 60-min session: warm-up → 1 tread → 1 floor → 1 tread → 1 floor → cool-down

        TREADMILL BLOCKS: Do NOT use rest_secs between rounds — instead include recovery jog exercises (easy pace) between sprint efforts. You never stop on a treadmill, you just slow down. Vary the treadmill style each block — pick from this menu:
        - Speed intervals: alternate sprint (30-60s) and recovery jog (20-30s)
        - Incline ladder: start at 10% incline, drop 1% each round at steady pace (or reverse — climb from 1% to 10%). IMPORTANT: each rung MUST have a duration_s (e.g. 45-60s per rung) so the athlete knows how long to run
        - Fartlek: unstructured pace changes — fast/moderate/easy in varying durations (e.g. 45s fast, 30s easy, 60s moderate, 20s sprint)
        - Tempo block: sustained moderate-hard pace for 8-12 minutes with brief surges
        - Hill repeats: high incline (8-12%) sprints with flat recovery jogs
        - Speed ladder: progressively faster efforts (build up then back down)
        - 1-min on/1-min off: classic interval format, sprint then easy jog
        Use the athlete's preferred speed unit (see Athlete Context) for all treadmill speeds.
        Never repeat the same treadmill style twice in one session.

        FLOOR BLOCKS: Dumbbell strength circuits, bench work, and bodyweight movements. Floor focus can be upper body, lower body, core, or a full-body mix — if the athlete provided session notes, let those guide the focus. Abs exercises can appear within floor blocks but there is NO separate abs section. IMPORTANT: do NOT use rowing machines, ski ergs, assault bikes, or any other cardio equipment on the floor. The treadmill is the only cardio machine in a Tread & Shred session.

        NO separate abs/core section. NO activation warm-up. The session is just: jog warm-up → alternating tread/floor blocks → cool-down stretch.

    # Alternator: alternating DIFFERENT cardio machines with floor strength
    "alternator" => {

      secondary: %w[tabata amrap ladder],
      guidance: <<~ALTERNATOR.strip
        Alternator sessions alternate between cardio machine efforts and floor strength circuits. This is the key concept: DIFFERENT cardio machines throughout the session, paired with targeted floor work.

        WARM-UP: Section name: "Warm-up". format: straight, duration_mins: 5. One exercise only — easy effort on any cardio machine with duration_s: 300. No stretching, no activation.

        MAIN SET STRUCTURE: Strictly alternate between cardio blocks and floor blocks. Each block is 8-12 minutes. Use a DIFFERENT cardio machine for each cardio block — this is what makes Alternator special. Example 60-min session:
        - warm-up → Ski Erg intervals → Upper Body Floor → Row intervals → Lower Body Floor → Assault Bike intervals → Core/Full Body Floor → cool-down
        Example 45-min session:
        - warm-up → Row intervals → Upper Body Floor → Assault Bike intervals → Lower Body Floor → cool-down

        CARDIO BLOCKS: Pick from assault bike, rowing machine, ski erg, and treadmill. Use a different machine each block. Vary the interval style:
        - Cal sprints: e.g. 10 cal sprint / 30s easy × 8
        - Distance repeats: e.g. 250m row / 30s rest × 6
        - Pace ladders: build intensity across rounds
        - Sustained efforts: 3-4 min at threshold pace
        - Alternating work/rest: 40s on / 20s off
        Do NOT use rest_secs — include easy-pace recovery on the same machine between efforts.

        FLOOR BLOCKS: Dumbbell and bodyweight strength circuits. Each floor block should have a clear focus that complements the surrounding cardio:
        - After ski erg (pull-heavy cardio) → push-focused floor (bench press, shoulder press, push-ups)
        - After rowing (full body) → lower body floor (squats, lunges, RDLs)
        - After assault bike (legs) → upper body floor (rows, presses, curls)
        - After treadmill (running) → core or full body floor
        This push/pull pairing keeps the session balanced and avoids fatiguing the same muscles back-to-back.

        NO separate abs/core section — abs exercises can appear within floor blocks. NO activation warm-up. The session is: easy cardio warm-up → alternating machine/floor blocks → cool-down stretch.

        ## Difficulty: Beginner
        This is a beginner session — scale everything accordingly:
        - **Reps per set:** 10–15 for bodyweight/conditioning; 8–12 for weighted strength work
        - **Weights:** ~50–60% of 1RM for barbell lifts; light dumbbells (5–10kg); bodyweight where possible
        - **Rest:** 90–120s between strength sets; 60–90s between conditioning intervals
        - **Movement complexity:** stick to simple, low-skill movements — goblet squats not back squats, dumbbell rows not cleans, ring rows not muscle-ups. No Olympic lifting.
        - **Volume:** keep total working sets low (2–3 per exercise). Do not stack too many exercises per section.
        - **EMOM:** ≤6 total reps per minute across all exercises
        - **Intensity:** comfortable effort, never redline. Focus on learning the movements.
      DIFF
    when "intermediate"
      <<~DIFF
        ## Difficulty: Intermediate
        This is an intermediate session — the athlete can handle solid effort and moderate complexity:
        - **Reps per set:** 8–12 for strength; 12–20 for conditioning; higher for bodyweight
        - **Weights:** ~65–75% of 1RM for barbell lifts; moderate dumbbells/kettlebells (12–24kg)
        - **Rest:** 60–90s between strength sets; 45–60s between conditioning intervals
        - **Movement complexity:** barbell squats, deadlifts, press variations fine. Simple kettlebell and gymnastics skills (kipping pull-ups, box jumps, KB swings) are appropriate. Avoid heavy Olympic lifting unless the session specifically calls for it.
        - **Volume:** 3–4 working sets per exercise. Sections can have 2–4 exercises.
        - **EMOM:** ≤9 total reps per minute across all exercises
        - **Intensity:** strong effort, should feel hard but sustainable. Some redline moments in finishers are fine.
      DIFF
    when "advanced"
      <<~DIFF
        ## Difficulty: Advanced
        This is an advanced session — the athlete is well-conditioned and can handle high volume, heavy loads, and complex movements:
        - **Reps per set:** 5–8 for heavy strength (85–90% 1RM); 15–25 for conditioning; higher for lighter bodyweight work
        - **Weights:** ~75–90% of 1RM for heavy work; RX competition weights for conditioning (e.g. 24kg KB, 20kg wall ball); heavy carries and sleds
        - **Rest:** 45–60s between conditioning sets; 90–120s only for true max-effort lifts
        - **Movement complexity:** all barbell movements including cleans, snatches, thrusters at moderate-heavy loads. Gymnastics (strict muscle-ups, handstand push-ups, toes-to-bar). Complex kettlebell work.
        - **Volume:** 4–5 working sets. Sections can be dense with 3–5 exercises. Total working time should feel relentless.
        - **EMOM:** ≤12 total reps per minute across all exercises
        - **Intensity:** should be genuinely hard. Redline in finishers and for-time sections is expected and appropriate.

        ## *** ATHLETE'S SESSION FOCUS — HIGHEST PRIORITY ***
        The athlete has specifically requested the following for this session. This OVERRIDES all other exercise selection rules. Read it carefully and apply it literally:

        >>> #{@session_notes} <<<

        INTERPRETATION RULES — apply the athlete's words exactly as written:
        - If they say to use specific equipment (e.g. "only use rower for cardio") → use ONLY that equipment for that purpose. Do not substitute other machines.
        - If they say to avoid something → do not include it anywhere in the session.
        - If they mention an injury or limitation → avoid all exercises that load or stress that area.
        - If they ask for specific exercises or equipment → those must appear prominently in multiple sections, not just once.
        - If they describe a training style:
          * "strength" / "hypertrophy" / "muscle" → heavy barbell/dumbbell sets (5×5, 4×8, 3×10) with proper rest. Minimise cardio. At least 70% dedicated lifting.
          * "cardio" / "conditioning" → sustained machine work, high-rep bodyweight, AMRAPs, EMOMs. At least 60% cardio.
        - If the notes describe equipment constraints or a limited setting → use ONLY what they mention. Everything else is banned.
        - The workout NAME should reflect the athlete's focus.
        - When in doubt, take the athlete's words at face value. They know what they want — your job is to build the best possible session within their constraints.

      - Main sets: do NOT set duration_mins on main sets — let the reps, rounds, and format define the work. Only amrap and emom sections need a duration_mins (their time cap). A short punchy finisher (e.g. Tabata, The Hundred/Centurion, for_time sprint) is a welcome extra at the end of the main work — but ONLY if the time budget allows it.
      #{core_rule}
      #{training_rule}
      - Rep counts and calorie targets must be "clean" numbers — even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20…) or multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25…). Never use odd, awkward counts like 13, 7, 11, 17, or 19. When scaling from competition volumes, round to the nearest clean number.
      - Be specific with reps, distances, and weights
      - SECTION NAMES MUST BE ACCURATE: never mention an exercise or activity in a section name unless it actually appears in that section's exercises. "Run + Station" must contain running. "Sled Circuit" must contain sled work. If unsure, use a generic evocative name instead.
      - NEVER use numbered block prefixes like "Block 1:", "Block 2:", "Block 3:" or "Part 1:", "Part 2:" in section names. Use creative, descriptive names instead.
      - Give it a punchy, memorable name — something a gym community would actually call it. Be creative and unpredictable: draw from feelings, imagery, places, days, animals, weather, mythology, slang — anything vivid. Actively vary the style each time (e.g. a cheeky two-worder one time, a dramatic three-worder the next, a dry/ironic name after that). NEVER use the session type name as the workout name — "#{main_name}" is the TYPE of session, not the name. The name must be original and creative. BANNED WORDS in workout names: Voltage, Maximum, Transformer, Dynamo, Alternator, Circuit Breaker, Tread & Shred, Iron Engine, Ohm — these are session type brands, not workout names. #{recent_names.any? ?

      #{sport_rule}
      #{pace_limits}
      - FORMAT SELECTION — choose the best format for each section. VARIETY IS MANDATORY: no two adjacent sections may share the same format, and across the full session you must use at least 3 different formats. Do not default to rounds and tabata for everything — ladders, amraps, rotating EMOMs, hundreds, and for_time efforts are equally valid and make sessions far more interesting. Here are the available formats:
        * tabata — high-intensity cardio bursts or bodyweight finishers. 20s on / 10s off × 8 rounds = exactly 4 minutes. Set duration_mins: 4. Do NOT set reps, calories, or distance_m on tabata exercises — the 20s interval is the only constraint. You may specify weight_kg where relevant. EXERCISE COUNT RULES: exercises in a tabata section must be exactly 1, 2, 4, or 8 (factors of 8). Multiple exercises ROTATE through the 8 rounds — 2 exercises = ABABABAB (4 rounds each), 4 exercises = ABCDABCD (2 rounds each), 8 exercises = each done once. Use a SEPARATE tabata section if you want two independent tabatas.
        * emom — two distinct styles, set emom_style accordingly:
          - circuit (emom_style: "circuit"): all exercises done together each minute, rest for the remainder. Max 2 exercises (3 only if all bodyweight). The work must be completable in ~40 seconds to leave rest. HARD REP CAP per minute: beginner ≤8, intermediate ≤12, advanced ≤16 total reps across all exercises. CARDIO MACHINE BAN: Do NOT include SkiErg, Rowing Machine, or Air/Assault Bike in a circuit EMOM — they take too long and leave no time for the other exercise(s). Use cardio machines in rotating EMOMs instead, where they get a full minute. E.g. "EMOM 10: 5 thrusters + 5 burpees". Set duration_mins for the total time cap.
          - rotating (emom_style: "rotating"): THE CONTINUOUS CIRCUIT — a different exercise each minute, cycling non-stop through the full duration. Each exercise fills its own minute — no reps, no calories, no distance, no duration on exercises. Do NOT add minute-assignment notes like "Min 1, 3, 5:" — exercises just rotate in order. Coaching notes only (e.g. "explosive hip extension"). duration_mins MUST be a multiple of the exercise count. *** FOR THIS SESSION use: #{cc_config} *** Mix one cardio machine + strength/skill movements + an active recovery or core exercise for best effect. The cardio minute is the "recovery" — keep it to a sustainable hard effort, not a sprint.
        * amrap — clock-driven main set. Complete as many rounds as possible in the time cap. Scores rounds+reps. Great for mixed-modal circuits, testing work capacity. MINIMUM 3 exercises — an AMRAP with 1 or 2 exercises makes no sense (you'd just do the same thing over and over). E.g. "AMRAP 12: 10 KB swings + 8 box jumps + 6 burpees". Use freely — this is underused and highly effective.
        * for_time — race the clock with minimal or no rest between rounds. The goal is to complete all the work as fast as possible and record the finishing time. Always set rounds explicitly (3–5 rounds typical) so the athlete knows the full volume up front. Do NOT set rest_secs (or set it to 0) — the athlete chooses when to breathe. E.g. "5 rounds for time: 20 cal SkiErg + 20 KB swings + 12 box jumps", "3 rounds for time: 400m row + 10 burpees". Single-exercise for_time (e.g. 100 cal row for time) can use rounds: 1.
        * hundred — "The Centurion": exactly 100 reps of a single exercise, done for time. Set reps: 100 on the one exercise. A genuinely brutal and satisfying finisher for ANY session type — not just Functional Muscle. Works for: KB swings, wall balls, box jumps, push-ups, burpees, thrusters, air squats, sit-ups, rowing calories, ski calories. Use it as a punchy end to a main set when you want one last gut-check. Not just a gimmick — it's a legitimate conditioning tool.
        * rounds — structured circuit with planned rest between rounds. The athlete works, rests a set time, then goes again — pacing is controlled, not a race. Good for strength work and conditioning where recovery matters. ALWAYS set rounds explicitly (e.g. rounds: 5 for 5×5 strength, rounds: 3 for a conditioning circuit) and set rest_secs (30–90s) for recovery between rounds.
        * ladder / mountain — rep or distance progression each rung. Highly effective and underused — use it regularly, not just occasionally. ONLY when all exercises share the same metric AND the step size is realistic:
          - reps: step 1–5. E.g. start:10 end:1 step:1 = 10,9,8...1 reps.
          - calories: step 5–10. E.g. start:20 end:5 step:5 = 20,15,10,5 cal.
          - distance_m: step 10–20. E.g. start:40 end:20 step:10 = 40m,30m,20m.
          - mountain: ascend then descend. E.g. start:5 peak:15 end:5 step:5 = 5,10,15,10,5 reps. Great for barbell strength work (Bears, cleans, deadlifts).
          IMPORTANT: Always set rest_between_rungs (30–60s) on ladder/mountain sections — athletes need recovery between rungs.
          - INVALID: mixing reps, distance, and calorie exercises in the same ladder.
          - INVALID: using ladder format for treadmill speed/pace changes — speeds are not reps or distances. For treadmill pace work (speed ladders, fartlek, pace builds), use format: straight with a single exercise. Protocol: 1 min at each speed + 1 min easy jog (10 km/h) between = 2 min per speed. E.g. 5 speeds (12→16 km/h) = 10 min total. Set duration_s for the total time. Notes: "12→16 km/h, 1 min at each speed with 1 min easy jog (10 km/h) between". ONE exercise only — do not add a separate recovery jog exercise.
        * straight — fixed sets with rest. Use for simple warm-ups or isolated single exercises.
        * matrix — progressive exercise combinations. List 3–5 exercises in order. The section builds up then strips back: for 3 exercises: A, A+B, A+B+C, B+C, C. For 4: A, A+B, A+B+C, A+B+C+D, B+C+D, C+D, D. For 5: A, A+B, A+B+C, A+B+C+D, A+B+C+D+E, B+C+D+E, C+D+E, D+E, E. IMPORTANT: all exercises must use the same metric — either all reps (same count each) or all duration_s (same seconds each). Prefer duration_s: 30 for each exercise most of the time — this is the most common Metafit style. Set rest_secs for the rest between each combination (typically 30–60s).
      - EXERCISE VARIETY ACROSS THE SESSION: never use the same base movement in more than one section. If Back Squat appears in one section, do NOT use Back Squat (or Paused Back Squat, or any squat variation on a barbell) in another section — pick a different compound like Front Squat, Deadlift, or Overhead Press instead. The whole session should expose the athlete to as many different movement patterns as possible.
      - NEVER repeat the same exercise as multiple entries in the exercises array. This is a critical mistake — do NOT list "Bench Press (Set 1)", "Bench Press (Set 2)", "Bench Press (Set 3)" as three separate entries. Instead, use a single entry and set rounds: 3 on the section. Notes like "Set 1:", "Set 2:" in exercise notes are forbidden.
      - SINGLE-EXERCISE SECTIONS are valid and often better than circuits, especially for strength and power work. A section with just one exercise is perfectly correct: e.g. '5 × 5 Deadlift (heavy)', 'EMOM 10: 8 Thrusters', '4 × 8 Romanian Deadlift'. Do not feel obligated to bundle every movement into a multi-exercise circuit. HOWEVER: a single-exercise section MUST always use multiple sets (rounds: 3 minimum) or a timed modality (emom/for_time). BANNED: a section with 1 exercise and rounds ≤ 2 (or no rounds). This is always wrong. Every section must represent real training volume, not a single isolated set. ALSO BANNED: AMRAP with fewer than 3 exercises — an AMRAP needs variety to cycle through.
      - NEVER describe the real programming in the notes instead of the structure. If you want 5 × 60m sprints, set rounds: 5 and distance_m: 60 — do NOT set rounds: 1 with "5 × 60m sprints" in the notes. The notes field is for coaching cues only (e.g. "explosive hip drive", "keep chest tall"). The structure (rounds, reps, distance_m, duration_s, rest_secs) must always reflect the actual work.
      - NEVER list the same exercise more than once in a section's exercises array. If you need the same movement repeated (e.g. 5 × 25m Freestyle), use rounds: 5 with a single exercise entry — not 5 separate entries. Duplicate entries are always wrong.

      *** CONTINUOUS CIRCUIT DURATION FOR THIS SESSION (pre-determined — do not change): #{cc} ***

      WEIGHTS: These are high-intensity metabolic sessions. Keep weights light and sustainable. Tabata/metabolic compound exercises: 8–12kg dumbbells, 12–16kg kettlebells. Bear Mountain barbell: 20–30kg only. Strength sets (5×10): sensible working weight — e.g. 40–60kg leg press, 20–30kg shoulder press, 15–25kg side raises. Do NOT prescribe heavy barbell weights (40kg+) for tabata or metabolic blocks. Do NOT prescribe 60kg+ for any strength section.

      SECTION NAMES: Give every section a short, punchy name — NEVER prefix with "Block 1:", "Block 2:", or any number. Numeric prefixes are banned. Tabatas: use fun creative names like "The Burner", "Sweat & Twist", "Ignition", "The Grind", "Pulse Raiser", "Chaos Round" — never "Tabata 1" or the exercise name. Metabolic blocks: use evocative names like "The Grind Loop", "Cardio Blitz", "The Ladder". Strength: "Upper Body Strength", "Lower Body Strength". The section name must accurately describe what's in it — don't call it "Abs Finisher" if the exercise is plate serves or bicep curls; call it "Functional Finisher" or "The Hundred" instead. Only use "Abs Finisher" or "Core 100" when the exercises are actual abs movements.

      *** CRITICAL: THE FIRST SECTION MUST BE A WARM-UP AND THE LAST SECTION MUST BE A COOL-DOWN. NEVER SKIP EITHER ONE. ***

      1. WARM-UP (MANDATORY — must be the FIRST section): format: straight, duration_mins: 5. ONE exercise only — pick one at random: "Easy Row" (Rowing Machine), "Easy Ride" (Assault Bike), or "Easy Ski" (Ski Erg) at easy pace. No mobility, no activation, no circuits. One machine, 5 mins. Give it a creative name.

      2. METABOLIC BLOCKS (always before strength): Build the metabolic section according to the SESSION SHAPE given above — it tells you exactly how many tabatas to include. Do not add extra tabatas beyond the count specified.

        TIME BUDGET — fixed sections consume half the session. You MUST stay within the metabolic budget or the session will run over. Calculate carefully:
          Fixed sections: Warm-up 5 min + Upper Body Strength 8 min + Lower Body Strength 8 min + Abs 5 min + Cool-down 4 min = 30 min
          Remaining for ALL metabolic blocks combined (including tabatas): #{@duration_mins - 30} min
          Each tabata = 4 min. Add up your chosen blocks — total must not exceed #{@duration_mins - 30} min.

        Block time estimates — use these to budget:
          Tabata [H]: 6 min (4 min work + transitions)
          Bear Mountain [I]: 10 min
          10-1 Ladder [C]: 12 min
          Continuous Circuit [A]: duration_mins as specified above
          Cardio Intervals [D]: 10 min (5 rounds × 2 min)
          Every-2-min EMOM [E]: 10 min
          Death Race [G]: 8 min
          Interval Circuit [B]: 10 min (5 rounds × 2 min)
          20-20 Block [F]: 20 min — only suitable for longer sessions (75+ min)

        - OTHER BLOCKS: Choose from [A]–[I] below to fill the session within the time budget. Do NOT always use the continuous circuit block — it should appear in roughly half of sessions at most.

        [A] CONTINUOUS CIRCUIT — format: emom, emom_style: rotating, #{cc}. One cardio machine (ski/row/bike) + one KB or barbell movement per exercise slot + optionally one abs or bodyweight movement. NO reps, calories, distance, or duration on any exercise — each fills its full minute. Coaching notes only. Do NOT label exercises with minute numbers. CARDIO MACHINE PACE GUIDE (1 minute of work): beginner 8 cal, intermediate 10 cal, advanced 12 cal — mention this target in the coaching notes only, not as a calories field.

        [B] INTERVAL CIRCUIT — format: rounds, rounds: 5. 2–3 exercises performed every 2 minutes (add this to section notes). Include specific reps and weights. E.g. 20 KB swings + 10 slams + 5 thrusters.

        [C] 10-1 LADDER — format: ladder, start: 10, end: 1, step: 1. ALWAYS exactly 3 exercises from contrasting movement patterns (push + pull + legs, or swing + slam + squat etc). VARY the exercises every session — do NOT default to KB Swings / Wall Balls / Box Jumps. Draw from this pool: KB Swings, Goblet Squats, KB Clean and Press, Thrusters, Upright Rows, Bent Over Rows, Renegade Rows, Burpees, Box Jumps, Step-ups, Jump Squats, Slam Ball, Push Press, Devil Press, DB Lunges, Plate Good Mornings, KB Deadlifts, Pull-ups, Ring Rows, Dips, Push-ups. Pick 3 that contrast (one cardio/plyometric, one push, one pull or hinge).

        [D] CARDIO INTERVALS — format: rounds, rounds: 5. 1 min hard / 1 min rest on a single machine. Calorie targets per minute: beginner 8 cal, intermediate 10 cal, advanced 12 cal. Row alternative: 150–200m per minute.

        [E] EVERY-2-MIN EMOM — format: emom, emom_style: circuit, duration_mins: 10. ALWAYS exactly 3 exercises done together at the start of every 2-minute window, rest for remainder. Reps are always multiples of 5. MINIMUM 25 total reps across all 3 exercises — never use 5/5/5 or any combination that totals less than 25. Use varied rep schemes: 15/10/5 (descending), 5/10/20 (ascending), 10/10/10 (even), 10/15/5. Total work per round should take 45–60 seconds leaving 60–75 seconds rest. E.g. 5 clean and press + 10 KB swings + 15 box jumps every 2 mins. Or: 10 thrusters + 10 burpees + 20 sit-ups every 2 mins.

        [F] 20-20 BLOCK — format: rounds, rounds: 10. Every 2 mins: cardio cal target (beginner 8, intermediate 10, advanced 12) + 20 reps of a punchy movement (KB swings, slams, jump squats). 20-minute total block. Only use for 75+ min sessions.

        [G] DEATH RACE — format: rounds, rounds: 5. Bike cal target (beginner 8, intermediate 10, advanced 12) + 10 burpees. All out.

        [H] TABATA — Use 2 exercises per tabata (ABABABAB = 4 rounds each) — this is the standard format. Standard tabatas: EVERY exercise MUST be a compound (two movements fused into one flowing rep, name must contain "and", "with", "to", or "+"). Each tabata gets DIFFERENT compound pairs — never repeat the same compound in one session. You are encouraged to INVENT new combinations — the goal is creative, flowing pairings that contrast muscle groups. Some examples to spark ideas (don't just copy these): "Squat Curl and Press", "KB Swing with Side Lunge", "Wood Chop with Reverse Lunge", "Bent Over Row to Deadlift", "Side Lunge and Lateral Raise", "Lunge and Overhead Tricep Extension", "Hop onto Box and Bicep Curl", "Clean and Lateral Lunge", "Squat Jump and Shoulder Press", "Plate Halo and Twist", "Push Up to T-Rotation", "Renegade Row to Deadlift", "Reverse Lunge and High Pull", "Squat and Rainbow Press", "Gorilla Row and Jump Squat", "Devil Press and Box Step", "KB Clean and Pivot Press", "Bent Over Row and Clean and Press". CARDIO MACHINE TABATA (use occasionally — at most once per session): one of the two exercises may be a cardio machine (Assault Bike, Rowing Machine, or Ski Erg) — pair it with a compound movement. Example pairings: Assault Bike + Squat Curl and Press, Rowing Machine + Wood Chop with Reverse Lunge, Ski Erg + KB Swing with Side Lunge. Do NOT set reps or calories on the machine exercise — it's a 20s burst, the interval is the constraint. Single compound movements alone (burpees, KB swings, mountain climbers without a second movement) are never acceptable.

        [I] BEAR MOUNTAIN — format: mountain, start: 1, peak: 5, end: 1, step: 1 (1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1 reps = 25 bears total). One exercise only: "Bear" (clean → press → front squat → press → back squat = 1 rep). Use a moderate barbell weight (20–30kg). Rest as needed between rungs. Takes approximately 10 minutes.

      3. UPPER BODY STRENGTH (after all metabolic blocks): MANDATORY — must be present in every session. ONE section only, named "Upper Body Strength". format: rounds, rounds: 5, rest_secs: 60, reps: 10. Exactly ONE exercise — pick one at random from this list each time: Low Row, Lat Pulldown, Bench Press, Shoulder Press, Chest Fly, Reverse Fly, Side Raises, Front Raises. Do NOT default to Lat Pulldown or Shoulder Press — every option is equally valid. One exercise, 5 rounds, 10 reps. Nothing else.

      4. LOWER BODY STRENGTH (after upper body): MANDATORY — must be present in every session. ONE section only, named "Lower Body Strength". format: rounds, rounds: 5, rest_secs: 60, reps: 10. Exactly ONE exercise — pick one at random from this list each time: Leg Press, Leg Extension, Leg Curl, Calf Raise, Squats, Deadlifts, Lunges. Do NOT default to Leg Press — every option is equally valid. One exercise, 5 rounds, 10 reps. Nothing else.

      5. ABS / PILATES 100 (after strength, always just before the cool-down): MANDATORY in 90% of sessions — only skip if the metabolic blocks already had heavy abs work throughout. Always 100 reps total, ~5 minutes. Choose ONE of these formats each time (vary across sessions):
        - format: hundred — 100 reps of a single non-abs pilates-style exercise (wall ball slams, bicep curls light, lateral raises light, plate serves). Do not use sit-ups or crunches here. Name the section after the exercise: "The Hundred" or a creative name like "Functional Finisher", "Shoulder Burn", "Plate Party" — NOT "Abs Finisher" (these aren't abs exercises).
        - format: straight — 4–5 abs exercises, each 20–25 reps, one pass through (total = ~100 reps). Name the section "Abs Finisher" or "Core 100" (these ARE abs exercises).
        - format: rounds, rounds: 5 — a single abs exercise × 20 reps per round, or rounds: 4 × 25 reps, or rounds: 2 × 50 reps.
        ABS EXERCISE MENU (pick from this list — mix them up across sessions, never repeat the same combination):
        Sit-ups, Crunches, Overhead crunches, Leg raises, Alternating toe touches, V-ups, Bicycle crunches, Russian twists, Flutter kicks, Hollow holds (timed), Dead bugs, Plank shoulder taps, Mountain climbers (slow), Side plank dips.
        Choose exercises that contrast what was already hit in the metabolic blocks. If the session had lots of KB swings and hip work, lean towards upper-abs and rotation. If it was push-heavy, choose leg raises and lower-abs work.

      6. COOL-DOWN (MANDATORY — must be the LAST section): format: straight, duration_mins: 5. 3–4 stretches targeting muscles worked in the session. No reps — use notes like "10 deep breaths" or "10 deep breaths each side". Give it a creative name (e.g. "Melt", "Fade Out", "Wind Down").

      *** REMINDER: You MUST include exactly 6 phases: (1) Warm-Up, (2) Metabolic blocks, (3) Upper Body Strength, (4) Lower Body Strength, (5) Abs/Pilates 100, (6) Cool-Down. The warm-up and cool-down are NOT optional — every FM session starts with a 5-min cardio machine warm-up and ends with a 5-min stretch cool-down. ***

      BANNED in Functional Muscle: activation blocks, mobility warm-up sequences, AMRAP, single sets of any weighted exercise, any rep scheme other than 5×10 or 5×5 for the strength sections, reps on 12-min rotating EMOM exercises, powerlifting-style main sets.

      You are an expert fitness coach with deep knowledge of group fitness programs, gym classes, and training methodologies.

      Describe the training program or class style called "#{program_name}" in enough detail that a personal trainer could accurately recreate a genuine session.

      Focus on:
      - The exact flow and structure of a typical session (phases, blocks, timing)
      - What the cardio component looks like — equipment, intervals, intensity
      - What the strength/floor work looks like — movements, rep ranges, loading, circuit style
      - Specific exercises with example prescriptions (reps, weight, duration)
      - What makes it feel distinctively like "#{program_name}" and not just a generic gym class

      ACCURACY IS CRITICAL — be precise and honest:
      - Only include equipment that is genuinely used in this specific program. If it is bodyweight-only, say so and do not list gym equipment.
      - Do not pad the exercise list with generic movements that aren't characteristic of this program.
      - If you are uncertain about something, be conservative rather than guessing.

      Use the describe_fitness_program tool to return your answer.
