| U201 | login-page | "Sign in with Apple" button | click | → N201 | — |
| U202 | registration-page | "Sign up with Google" button | click | → N200 | — |
| U203 | registration-page | "Sign up with Apple" button | click | → N201 | — |
| N200 | OmniAuth Google | Redirect to Google OAuth → callback → find_or_create user | redirect | → S_users | → feed |
| N201 | OmniAuth Apple | Redirect to Apple OAuth → callback → find_or_create user | redirect | → S_users | → feed |

**What to build:**
- Add `omniauth`, `omniauth-google-oauth2`, `omniauth-apple` gems
- `oauth_identities` table: user_id, provider (string), uid (string), unique index on [provider, uid]
- OmniAuth initializer with Google + Apple credentials (stored in Rails credentials)
- `OauthCallbacksController`: handles `/auth/:provider/callback`; finds existing identity or creates new user + identity; signs in
- Link existing account: if a user signs in with OAuth and the email matches an existing account, link the identity to that account
- OAuth buttons on sign-in and registration pages (styled with provider brand guidelines)
- Keep email/password login as fallback — OAuth is additive, not a replacement
- CSRF protection: OmniAuth `allowed_request_methods: [:post]`

**Demo:** Visit sign-in page → tap "Sign in with Google" → Google consent screen → redirected back → signed in on feed. Next visit: tap Google again → instant sign-in (no registration needed).

**What to build:**
- `personal_records` table + model (keyed by exercise name string, not exercise_id — no exercise library table)
- `PRDetectionService`: after WorkoutLog created, iterate logged exercises, compare each metric vs best; write new record if better
- Turbo Stream broadcast of PR badge after WorkoutLog#create
- PR badges on workout log post detail
- Progress tab in profile/library: exercise name search → Chartkick line chart + PR overlays
- Add `chartkick` + `groupdate` gems

**Demo:** Log a heavier deadlift → PR badge appears on screen → open Progress → select Deadlift → see weight over time with PR marked.

**What to build:**
- `training_plans`, `training_plan_weeks`, `training_plan_sessions` tables + models
- Plan creation form (goal, type, duration, sessions/week) — Pro-gated
- `TrainingPlanGeneratorJob`:
  - Week 1: call `WorkoutLLMGenerator` N times for the chosen session type
  - Week 2+: remix each week-1 workout with prompt suffix: "Increase all working loads by {overload_pct}%, add 1 set to the main working block"
  - Overload schedule: W1=0%, W2=+5%, W3=+7%, W4=+5%, W5=−20% (deload), W6=test/benchmark

- `WorkoutLogsController#share_card`: generate PNG, serve as `image/png` for download or Base64 for JS share API
- Use Web Share API (`navigator.share({ files: [png] })`) on mobile for native share sheet; fallback to download link on desktop

**Demo:** Tap Share on a workout post → native share sheet opens with a styled workout image → share to WhatsApp/Instagram Stories.

---

## V16: AI Coaching Insights (Pro)

**Shape parts:** None (standalone, Pro-only)

**Model strategy:** Workout generation uses Claude Haiku (fast, structured, follows rules well). Coaching features use Claude Sonnet (better reasoning and narrative quality; acceptable on on-demand or async requests where speed matters less).

### V15a: Coach's Notes (on-demand, any workout)

| # | Component | Affordance | Control | Wires Out | Returns To |
|---|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| U128 | workout/show | "Coach's Notes" button (lazy Turbo Frame) | click | → N128 | U129 |
| U129 | coaching-notes | Coaching rationale: why these reps/loads, what to focus on, how it fits a training week | render | — | — |
| N128 | CoachingNotesController#show | Receives workout_id; builds prompt from workout structure + user context; calls Sonnet; caches result against workout_id forever | call | → S_notes | U129 |
| S_notes | coaching_notes | workout_id, narrative (text), generated_at | — | — | — |

**What to build:**

- `CoachingNotesController`: lazy Turbo Frame; calls Sonnet with workout structure + user context; returns 3-4 sentences covering rationale, focus cues, and training context
- Button on workout show page inside a `<turbo-frame>` — only fires on tap, not on page load
- Available to all users (good showcase of AI depth; not gated behind Pro)

**Demo:** Tap "Coach's Notes" on a Hyrox workout → "This session targets your ski erg and sled push weak points identified in your last race. The 65% rep counts give you enough stimulus to build capacity without the CNS cost of a full simulation. Focus on hip extension at the top of each ski pull…"

### V15b: Weekly Coaching Digest (Pro, async)

| S_insights | coaching_insights | user_id, week_start, stats_json, narrative, generated_at | — | — | — |

**What to build:**
- `coaching_insights` table
- `GenerateCoachingInsightJob`: Solid Queue recurring, Pro users only; aggregates: session count, total volume (sets × reps × kg), workout types, avg sweat rating, PRs set, streak status vs 4-week rolling average; calls Sonnet for 3-sentence coaching narrative + 1 action recommendation
- Coaching tab on profile (Pro badge): this week's digest + last 4 weeks history
- Load management flag: if this week's volume > 130% of 4-week avg, include "Consider a lighter session this week" warning

**Demo (Pro):** Monday morning → open app → coaching tab shows "You trained 4 times last week, up from your 3-session average. Your deadlift volume hit a new high. This week: consider one lower-body recovery session."

- VAPID key pair (generated once, stored in credentials)
- `push_subscriptions` table: user_id, endpoint, p256dh, auth
- `web-push` gem: send notifications on follow request, challenge leaderboard position, plan week ready
- Install prompt: Stimulus controller that catches `beforeinstallprompt` event; shows banner after 3 app loads
- Push permission request prompt on profile settings

**Demo:** Install app to home screen → enable notifications → receive push when a friend follows you → open offline → see cached feed → log a workout → it syncs when back online.

---

## V18: Native Apps (iOS + Android)

**Shape parts:** E1–E5

**Notes:** This is a large programme of work — plan as its own project once PWA is stable and user numbers justify the investment. The web app's Hotwire architecture can be wrapped in a native shell (Turbo Native) as the fastest path to App Store presence.

**Approach options (decide at V17 planning):**
- **Turbo Native** (fastest): thin Swift/Kotlin shell wrapping the Rails Hotwire web app. Full feature parity immediately. Push via APNs/FCM. HealthKit bridge via native code.
- **React Native**: single JS codebase for iOS + Android. More work upfront but better native feel. Requires Rails JSON API.
- **Swift/Kotlin native**: most native feel, best HealthKit/Google Fit integration, most work.

**What to build (regardless of approach):**
- Rails API endpoints (JSON) for all data: workouts, logs, feed, profile, plans, challenges
- Token-based auth (replace session cookies)
- APNs / FCM push replacing Web Push
- App Store / Google Play listings
- Turbo Native bridge or React Native app

**Demo:** Download from App Store → log in → full app with push notifications → Apple Watch HR data on workout post.

---

## V19: Device Integration (native app required)

**Shape parts:** F1–F6

**Dependency:** V17 must ship first. HealthKit requires a native iOS app. Google Health Connect requires native Android.

| # | Component | Affordance | Control | Wires Out | Returns To |
|---|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| U150 | workout-log-form | "Import from Apple Watch" toggle (iOS only) | toggle | → native bridge | — |

| U152 | workout-log-detail | Full HR zone breakdown chart | render | — | — |
| N150 | Native bridge | Request HealthKit / Google Fit workout data for session timeframe | call | → device | — |
| N151 | WorkoutLogsController#update | Store device_stats jsonb: avg_hr, max_hr, hr_zones, calories, duration_s | call | → S2 | — |

**What to build:**
- Native bridge (Swift/Kotlin or React Native module): read HealthKit HKWorkoutSession or Google Health Connect session
- Request permissions on first log post-install
- Match device workout to BSB log by start time ± 5 minutes
- `device_stats` jsonb column on `workout_logs`: `{ avg_hr, max_hr, hr_zones: {z1..z5}, active_calories, source }`
- Feed card: compact stat badge when device_stats present
- Workout log detail: HR zone breakdown as simple bar chart (Chartkick or native chart)
- Garmin Health API as optional web-accessible data source (interim before native — REST API + OAuth2)

**Demo (native app):** Complete a workout wearing Apple Watch → post log → BSB automatically pulls HR + calories → feed card shows "❤️ 148 avg · 🔥 420 kcal" → tap for HR zone breakdown.

| U163 | weekly-board | Weekly community leaderboard (most sessions, heaviest lift, etc.) | render | — | — |
| N160 | ChallengesController#create | Create friend challenge record; send push notification | call | → S_challenges | — |

**What to build:**
- Friend challenge: tap "Challenge" on a workout log → pick a follower → they get a push notification; if they log the same workout within 7 days, both get a notification comparing results
- Weekly community leaderboards: most workouts, highest sweat rating average, heaviest single lift — reset each Monday; shown on a Challenges tab
- `friend_challenges` table: challenger_id, challenged_id, workout_id, created_at, responded_at

**Demo:** Tap "Challenge" on your Hyrox workout → pick Sarah → Sarah gets push → Sarah logs it → both see side-by-side comparison.
